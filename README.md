## tesseract-generator

Small program that generates vertices and indices for tesseract that I used to render it as a model.
In its base for, it will end up generating sides multiples times. Four triangles are generated for one
tesseract face. Comments are given in the code that point to what should be done if fewer triangles are
to be generated.
